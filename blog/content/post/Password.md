I have your password





Passwords are a pain. You have to remember them for a start and you are supposed to use different passwords on every site, and they ought to be complicated. It all seems like a lot of effort. Is it really worth it ? 

I have the hash killer list and on it there are a hell of alot of passwords. The list is not a secret; lots of people have it. The list is long and getting longer every day. Some example passwords on the list are:

•DarkJediPrincess


•RainbowJumper<3


•Italianstud1978


•{[brainy]}


•stupid is as stupid does


The list contains the top 25 passwords of 2017 and another 34 million and counting.

Because choosing and remembering a password is hard, people reuse the same password across multiple sites: Paypal, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, LinkedIn, Adobe, Reddit, Skype, Twitter, Pinterest, Flickr, Spotify, Talk Talk etc.

Now you are wondering how does a hacker know which password yours is ? Well they have to wait until a someone (e.g. a bored teenager) hacks one of the many sites you use and steals all of the email addresses and passwords and posts them online. The passwords are usually cryptographically one way hashed for example as “1aa3fdd77c64b143504ea30d67e5425e”, this hash can’t be converted back into the plain text, but If they know how the hashing is done and they probably do, then they can try each password in the list and if they get a match then they have both your email and your password. 

Once they know your email address and password then they can try logging in to all of the popular sites using this combination and see if I get any hits. Once an account is compromised it can be sold online and criminals can exploit it.

Even if your password is not in the list then using brute force is another approach where all combinations of letters and numbers are tried, but this is slowed by the type of hashing algorithm and the length of the password.

So, how do you avoid any of your accounts being compromised? Well, you can’t avoid it completely so you need to limit your exposure by using a different password on every site. Memorising all those passwords is going to be nightmare, so using a password manager such as 1Password to keep track of them is sensible. If that is too much trouble, then the longer the better, ideally a unique phrase memorable to you “My son's birthday is 12 December, 2004.”. Diceware https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware is another means to create a random pass phrase.
