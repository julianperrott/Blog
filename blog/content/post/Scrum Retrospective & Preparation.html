It is probably the most important event from the teams point of view.&nbsp; </p> <p>There are usually a number of questions the team is asked,&nbsp; such as:</p> <p>What should we: </p>
<ol> <li>Start doing.  <li>Stop doing  <li>Continue doing </li></ol>
<p><a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective/">http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective/</a></p> <p>or </p>
<ol>
    <li>What did we do well, that if we don’t discuss we might forget?
    <li>What did we learn?
    <li>What should we do differently next time?
    <li>What still puzzles us?</li>

<ol> <li>What went well?  <li>What could be improved?</li></ol> <p>

</p>
<p>At the start of the retrospective the team is given some time to think about the questions and create comments.  <p>
    If the team is in the same room for the retrospective they can write their comments on post-it notes and put them on a white board. If team is a blended on/offshore one then I don’t recommend sitting in a meeting room around a conference phone, either a virtual white board (e.g.
    <a href="http://en.linoit.com">en.linoit.com</a>) or a wiki document can be used, with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">VOIP</a> (e.g. <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a>) for each team member. The comments are then discussed, prioritised and if actions are possible are assigned to the team or scrum master to progress.
<p><iframe height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L2zoKCbBvAw" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen></iframe> <H3>Pre-planning</H3> <p>Population of the comments can be done prior to the meeting. Each team member is directed to either populate a shared document or send their points to the scrum master who can add them. Then during the retrospective the document acts as list of items to discuss:
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The time spent during the retrospective is reduced as there is no need for thinking time to create the items to discuss.
    <li>If working in a on/offshore blended team where a whiteboard can’t be used, then problems where everyone is trying to add their items to a shared document at the same time won’t occur.
    <li>It’s easier for the scrum master / project leads to pre-investigate any points which they are not aware of.
    <li>The items are pre-documented so less note taking is needed during the retrospective. </li>
</ul> <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p><strong></strong>
<ul>
    <li>The activity is not seen as a priority over other work resulting in a lack of participation by some team members.
    <li>Once the retrospective has started team members feel they don’t need to add any more items. </li>
</ul> <p>Personally I prefer not to do pre-planning so that all team members get the time to think and contribute.</p>
